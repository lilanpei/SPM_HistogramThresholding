2.3 Histogram Thresholding

This module performs histogram thresholding on an image. Given an integer
image I and a target percentage p, it constructs a binary image B such that
Bi,j is set if no more than p percent of the pixels in I are brighter than
Ii,j . The input data are therefore the matrix I and the percentage p. The
thresholding must be applied to a stream of input images.

Please check out the file SPM1718_project_LanpeiLi.pdf for all the details

Thanks.
